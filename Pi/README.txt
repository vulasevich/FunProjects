The test project calculates pi using a modified Monte Carlo method.
Instead of randomly selecting the coordinates of a point, the program chooses points at regular intervals. This removes randomness from the results.

I compared two algorithms and found that the modified algorithm calculates pi faster and more accurately than the Monte Carlo method.
The regular Monte Carlo method uses the random function many times, which takes up computing power and causes delays.
