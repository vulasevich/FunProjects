The project creates a simple 2D platformer game using the SFML library. 
Player interacts with blocks created on a grid and features basic physics like gravity and collisions.
In the future, I will make a level editor to save levels as JSON or TXT files in project folder.
Also I want to add more blocks into the game like red ones that kill the player
