The project creates a simple 2D platformer game using the SFML library. 
Player interacts with blocks placed by float coordinates and features basic physics like gravity and collisions.
There is two types of blocks, but I will add more in the future
In the future, I will make a level editor to save levels as JSON or TXT files in project folder.
